     <strong>PTSD-Engine</strong> is most likely the biggest project I've worked on. It's a <strong>custom 3D engine built from the ground up available on Windows and Linux.</strong>.<br/>
     It's written on C++ and LUA. Users are able to write scripts on LUA in which they are able to customize their games with the assets they desire.<br/><br/>

     2 basic games were created for testing purposes using this tool: <strong>Ta1Fighter</strong> and <strong>Glock the Clock</strong>. These games are not much to write home about, but for anyone who has
     worked on something similar, they're really cool.

        PCE or <strong>Programa de convivencia espacial</strong>, spanish for "Space coexistance program" is a thing of beauty that I am so proud of. I could write about it for hours.<br/><br/>
        In this online 2D party-game, up to 4 players compete in fast-paced rounds that evoke the discrepancies between flatmates, but in <strong>SPACE</strong>. It's kind of like Duck-Game, but in 0 gravity.<br/>
        Players can move around jumping from various objects and platforms, and they have a deadly assortment of weapons at their disposal that they can use to defeat oposing players.<br/>
        There is also a variety of maps, each of them including new and different platforms and hazards.<br/><br/>

        This game was written on C++ using SDL2 and Box2D.<br/>
        The purpose of this game was purely educational to familiarize us into the workflow of game development and to gain proficiency with C++.

        <strong>Tri-Towers</strong> is a fun <strong>tower defense browser game</strong> written on JS using Phaser.<br/><br/>
        In this game, each tower and enemy belong to one of three differente elements (fire, water, grass) and they each resist and are super-effective to a different element.<br/>
        The hook of the game is that the element of every tower the player has placed on the map can be changed to the next one (fire into water, water into grass...) with the press of a button. The player
        is supposed to change the element of every tower according to the needs of every round.
